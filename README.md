👋 Hi there!
------------

My name is Maximiliano E Lutz
=============================

Junior Python Developer
-----------------------

I am a self-taught Python/SQL/JavaScript developer looking to gain practical experience in the technology sector (particulary in software development or data anaysis) and learn new skills, concepts and methodologies around Python/SQL/JavaScript syntaxes that can help me boost my career and ultimately pave my way either into Software Development or Data Analytics.

*   🌍  I'm based in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Soon moving to Berlin, Germany).
*   ✉️  You can contact me at [maximiliano.lutz1997@gmail.com](mailto:maximiliano.lutz1997@gmail.com)
*   🧠  I'm currently completing my JavaScript Algortihms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp.org. My next goal will be to either complete the Frontend Development Libraries Certifications or the Data Analysis with Python Certification.
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on anything related to Python, SQL, JavaScript and software development.

Thank you for taking an interest in my profile and my work content. I'm open to and appreciate any help, constructive criticism and guidance you wish to provide me. I will always be grateful for it.


📌 PS: I apologize, I know it's weird and a bit unprofessional perhaps to have such a large meme on the frontpage of my profile, but I like to think this picture, couldn't better describe my work.
